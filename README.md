# OSBot-Script-Auther
OSBot Script Auther is a tool which adds a simpler way for scripter writers to give trials to users on the site [OSBot.org](https://OSBot.org).
This tool is made by [Diclonius](https://osbot.org/forum/profile/655-diclonius/)

This tool adds a drop down menu at the bottom of a comment in all OSBot threads like this:

and on all profile pages like this:

Auth types can be added via a web interface:
